use C0402 everywhere possible

the Flash is divided into two banks: the first bank is 512Kb and the second one is 256Kb (768Kb in total)
thought: store the code in bank1 and store the non-volatile data in bank2

Bootloader:activate by apply Pattern3
60--BOOT0
28--BOOT1
BFB2--in the user option memory?

USART1 be used in simple debug situation   (USART2(remapped) is not available on LQFP64)
41--USART1_CK
42--USART1_TX
43--USART1_RX
44--USART1_CTS
45--USART1_RTS

CONNECT to JTAG


CONNECT to mpu6050
57--I2C1_SMBA
58--I2C1_SCL
59--I2C1_SDA

CONNECT to motor driver
GPIO*4
PWM*2

CONNECT to infarred sensor

AVOID:
there is a tempurature sersor at ADC1_IN16
