1.make sure you have make. For windows install MINGW. For MAC install XCODE. Make usually come with a linux distro. 

2.download the arm-none-eabi toolchain for your system and extract them into /Code folder (and pls rename to arm-none-eabi)

known issue: some 64 bit system might need ia32-libs to run 32 bit program(or NO such file or directory error appear)
For me(ubuntu 14.04 64 bit):sudo apt-get install libc6-i386

3.download the STM32F10X Library and extract them into /Code folder too

in the end should look like this:
/code
	/arm-none-eabi
		/arm-none-eabi
		/bin
		/lib
		/share
	/STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0
		/Libraries
		...
	Makefile
	main.c
	...

4.there is a known error in core_cm3.c, updated accord to the reference.

5.copy ./STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0/Project/STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template/stm32f10x_conf.h to ./stm32f10x_conf.h
since I use the USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER option(not sure)

6.type make and the whole program should be compiled, althougth not sure if it is right because no test tools
