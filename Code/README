arm-none-eabi toolchain: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded
STM flash loader: http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF257525
ST-LINK utility: http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF258168

1.make sure you have make. For windows install MINGW. For MAC install XCODE. Make usually come with a linux distro.

2.download the arm-none-eabi toolchain for your system and extract them into /Code folder (and pls rename to arm-none-eabi)

known issue: some 64 bit system might need ia32-libs to run 32 bit program(or NO such file or directory error appear)
For me(ubuntu 14.04 64 bit):sudo apt-get install libc6-i386

It is better to add the toolchain into PATH

3.first make the submodule(libopencm3):go into the folder and make

4.make the project

uMouse Pin out(HEAD UP)
RST|VCC
TMS|TX			TMS:SWDIO
TDO|RX
TCK|GND			TCK:SWCLK

Discovery(USB UP)
VDD(use 3.3V on board)
SWCLK
GND
SWDIO


notes:
1.	stm32f10x_conf.h comes from /STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0/Project/STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template/
	reason: USE_STDPERIPH_DRIVER

2.	stm32_flash.ld comes from /STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0/Project/STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Template/TrueSTUDIO/STM3210E-EVAL_XL
	reason: need to modify linker script for different MCU

3.	debug:
	1.use texane/stlink to start the gdb server: st-util --stlinkv1
	2.load the compiled code: arm-none-eabi-gdb uMouse.elf
			Which can be awoke by: make debug
	3.connect to gdb server: (gdb) target extended localhost:4242
			Or simply tar ext :4242
	4.load the code: load

The second debug approach:
		1. use openocd to start gdb server: openocd -f interface/stlink-v1.cfg -f board/stm32vldiscovery.cfg
		2. Follow the same step as before.
