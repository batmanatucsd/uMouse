arm-none-eabi toolchain: https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded
stm32f10x library: http://www.st.com/web/en/catalog/tools/PF257890


1.download the arm-none-eabi toolchain and extract them into /Code folder (and pls rename to arm-none-eabi)

known issue: some 64 bit system might need ia32-libs to run 32 bit program(or NO  such file or directory error appear)
For me(ubuntu 14.04 64 bit):sudo apt-get install libc-i386

2.download the STM32F10X Library and extract them into /Code folder too


in the end should look like this:
/code
	/arm-none-eabi
		/arm-none-eabi
		/bin
		/lib
		/share
	/STM32F10x_StdPeriph_Lib_V3.5.0
	Makefile
	main.c
	...
